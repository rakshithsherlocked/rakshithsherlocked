## 🚀 What I Enjoy Building

I enjoy building end-to-end products where **robust backend systems** meet
**intuitive, high-quality user interfaces**.

Over the past few years, I’ve designed and developed **full-stack applications**
using React, Next.js, Node.js, and NestJS from interactive dashboards and
real-time geospatial applications to scalable REST and GraphQL APIs.

On the frontend, I focus on **performance and usability**, applying techniques like
lazy loading, code splitting, memoization, and reusable component architectures.
I’ve worked extensively with UI frameworks such as **Tailwind, Material UI, AntD,
and Bootstrap** to deliver responsive, accessible interfaces.

On the backend, I’ve built **clean, scalable APIs** using Express.js and NestJS,
working with **Prisma ORM**, SQL, and NoSQL databases. I care deeply about
maintainable code, testability, and system stability in production.

More recently, I’ve been exploring **AI-powered systems**, including
Generative AI, RAG-based architectures, and LLM integrations using Python,
PyTorch, Keras, and modern AI APIs.

What motivates me most is building systems that are **fast, reliable, and easy to
evolve** software that teams can confidently scale over time.
